To resolve this, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Reduce bundle size:** Remove unused packages and code. Optimize images and other assets. Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify large modules.
2. **Increase memory limit:** If the machine has sufficient RAM, increase the memory limit allowed for Metro. This can be done by setting environment variables such as `MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE` in the terminal before running Expo.
3. **Code optimization:** Split code into smaller chunks (code splitting) to improve loading time and memory management. Avoid creating unnecessary closures or large objects in memory. Use more efficient data structures and algorithms where appropriate.
4. **Async loading:** Load non-critical components and resources asynchronously using techniques like lazy loading. This prevents blocking the main thread and reduces the initial memory footprint.
5. **Check for memory leaks:** Use debugging tools to identify and eliminate memory leaks in the application's code. Tools such as Chrome DevTools or React Developer Tools can help diagnose memory-related issues.
